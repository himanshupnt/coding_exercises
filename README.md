### Coding Exercises (with tests)

This repo contains my solutions (in [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)) to coding exercises from various resources.

The goal of doing these exercises is, to -

* better understand common data structure implementations and algorithms.
* implement Jest tests.
* improve logical thinking and problem solving.
* improve speed to solve such problems.
